    "- we can generate an extremely large number of perturbation coefficients (thousands) in a relatively short time and without the need for parallelization;\n",
    "- since the random files are not created, not only we save computer time, but also disk space (the excel files are very small);\n",
    "- the perturbation coefficients can be used to ensure reproducibility in the random files;\n",
    "- also, the perturbation coefficients do not need to be used in their entirety, but can be split into blocks that are more manageable in terms of computer resources - e.g., random files can be created sequentially in chunks of 100;\n",
    "- having available perturbation coefficients opens up possibilities in terms of sensitivity analysis."
