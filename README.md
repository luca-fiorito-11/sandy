# SANDY

SANDY is a python package that can read, write and perform a set of operations on nuclear data file in 
[ENDF-6 format](https://www.oecd-nea.org/dbdata/data/manual-endf/endf102.pdf).
The primay objective of the code, as it was originally conceived, is to produce *perturbed files* containing sampled parameters 
that represent the information stored in the evaluated nuclear data covariances.
Such files can be ultimately used to propagate uncertainties through any given compatible system using a brute force technique.

Currently, SANDY can draw samples for:
 - cross sections;
 - angular distrbutions of outgoing particles;
 - energy distrbutions of outgoing particles;
 - fission neutron multiplicities;
 - fission yields.
 
The sampling algorithm constructs multivariate normal distributions with a unit vector for mean and with relative 
covariances taken from the evaluated files.
Perturbation factors are sampled with the same multigroup structure of the covariance matrix, and are applied to the pointwise 
data to produce the perturbed files.

#### <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

##### <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

SANDY is developed in `Python 3` and does not support `Python 2`.
In order to run SANDY, make sure that you have a version of `Python 3` installed.

The following dependencies are required to ensure the correct functioning of SANDY:

```
* pandas >= 0.20
* numpy
* scipy
* pytest >= 3.3
* matplotlib
* bokeh >= 0.12.10
* fortranformat >= 0.2.5
```

##### <a name="installation"></a>Installation

To download SANDY, move to the folder where you want the source code and type

```git
git clone https://github.com/luca-fiorito-11/sandy.git
```

To install SANDY, run the following commands

```bash
cd sandy
python setup.py install
```

Make sure that `python` points to a correct `Python 3` executable for which you have administration rights.

To quickly check if SANDY was installed correctly, type

```bash
sandy --version
```

#### <a name="running-the-tests"></a>Running the tests

Once the installation is completed, type the following from any directory to automatically run SANDY's automated tests

```bash
sandy_tests
```

```sandy_tests``` accepts any ```pytest``` command line option.
Therefore, add the following options to:
 - ```-s``` to disable all captures
 - ```-v``` to display more information
 - ```--durations=N``` to get a list of the slowest 10 test durations
 
 ```bash
# Example
sandy_tests -s -v --durations=10
```

#### <a name="usage"></a>Usage

For an overview of SANDY's usage type

```bash
sandy --help
```

The command output is reported below

```
usage: sandy [-h] (--endf6-cov ENDF6_COV | --errorr-cov ERRORR_COV)
             [--samples SAMPLES] [--outdir OUTDIR] [-np PROCESSES] [--eig N]
             [-e ENERGY_POINT] [-v]
             file

Run SANDY

positional arguments:
  file                  ENDF-6 or PENDF format file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --endf6-cov ENDF6_COV
                        ENDF-6 file containing covariances.
  --errorr-cov ERRORR_COV
                        ERRORR file containing covariances.
  --samples SAMPLES     Number of samples.
  --outdir OUTDIR       Target directory where outputs are stored (default =
                        current working directory). If it does not exist it
                        will be created.
  -np PROCESSES, --processes PROCESSES
                        Number of worker processes (default=1).
  --eig N               Print the first N eigenvalues of the evaluated
                        covariance matrices (default = 0, do not print).
  -e ENERGY_POINT, --energy-point ENERGY_POINT
                        Additional energy points (in eV) to include in the
                        incoming-neutron energy grid (default = None). Provide
                        each energy point as an individual optional argument,
                        e.g. -e 100.0 -e 201.5
  -v, --version         SANDY's version.
