<h1 align="center" style="font-family:simplifica">SANDY</h1>


<h5 align="center">Sampling tool for nuclear data</h5>

<br>
 

SANDY is a python package that can read, write and perform a set of operations on nuclear data files in
[ENDF-6 format](https://www.oecd-nea.org/dbdata/data/manual-endf/endf102.pdf).

### Stochastic sampling of nuclear data 
The primary objective of the code, as it was originally conceived, is to produce *perturbed files* containing sampled parameters 
that represent the information stored in the evaluated nuclear data covariances.
Such files can be ultimately used to propagate uncertainties through any given compatible system using a brute force technique.

Currently, SANDY can draw samples for:
 - cross sections;
 - angular distrbutions of outgoing particles;
 - energy distrbutions of outgoing particles;
 - fission neutron multiplicities;
 - fission yields.

### API for ENDF-6 files
The recent development on SANDY extended the original goal and focused on providing a simple interface for nuclear data files in ENDF-6 format.
Nuclear data such as cross sections, fission yields, radioactive decay constants and so on can be imported into tabulated dataframes (making extensive use of `pandas`) for further post-processing, analysis, plotting, ...

Examples are available [here](https://luca-fiorito-11.github.io/sandy_notebooks/).
