<h1 align="center" style="font-family:simplifica">SANDY</h1>


<h5 align="center">Sampling tool for nuclear data</h5>

<br>
 

SANDY is a python package that can read, write and perform a set of operations on nuclear data files in 
[ENDF-6 format](https://www.oecd-nea.org/dbdata/data/manual-endf/endf102.pdf).
The primary objective of the code, as it was originally conceived, is to produce *perturbed files* containing sampled parameters 
that represent the information stored in the evaluated nuclear data covariances.
Such files can be ultimately used to propagate uncertainties through any given compatible system using a brute force technique.

Currently, SANDY can draw samples for:
 - cross sections;
 - angular distrbutions of outgoing particles;
 - energy distrbutions of outgoing particles;
 - fission neutron multiplicities;
 - fission yields.

## :video_game: Jupyter notebooks

[Here](https://luca-fiorito-11.github.io/sandy_notebooks/) you can find some cool [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that kind of give an idea of what one can do with SANDY.

## :bookmark: Acknowledgments

SANDY was conceived and developed as a part of the PhD thesis on *Nuclear data uncertainty propagation and uncertainty quantification in nuclear codes* in the framework of a collaboration between [SCK-CEN](https://www.sckcen.be) and [ULB](http://www.ulb.ac.be).
