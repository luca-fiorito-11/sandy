# SANDY

SANDY is a python package that can read, write and perform a set of operations on nuclear data file in 
[ENDF-6 format](https://www.oecd-nea.org/dbdata/data/manual-endf/endf102.pdf).
The primay objective of the code, as it was originally conceived, is to produce *perturbed files* containing sampled parameters 
that represent the information stored in the evaluated nuclear data covariances.
Such files can be ultimately used to propagate uncertainties through any given compatible system using a brute force technique.

Currently, SANDY can draw samples for:
 - cross sections;
 - angular distrbutions of outgoing particles;
 - energy distrbutions of outgoing particles;
 - fission neutron multiplicities.
 
The sampling algorithm constructs multivariate normal distributions with a unit vector for mean and with relative 
covariances taken from the evaluated files.
Perturbation factors are sampled with the same multigroup structure of the covariance matrix, and are applied to the pointwise 
data to produce the perturbed files.

## Acknowledgments

SANDY was conceived and developed as a part of the PhD thesis on *Nuclear data uncertainty propagation and uncertainty quantification in nuclear codes* in the framework of a collaboration between [SCK-CEN](https://www.sckcen.be) and [ULB](http://www.ulb.ac.be).
